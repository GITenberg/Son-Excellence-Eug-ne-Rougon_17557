description: "Son Excellence Eugène Rougon is the sixth novel in the Rougon-Macquart\
  \ series by Émile Zola. It was serialized in 1876 in Le Siècle before being published\
  \ in novel form by Charpentier. It was translated into English by Mary Neal Sherwood\
  \ (as Clorinda) in 1880, by Kenward Philp (as The Mysteries of Louis Napoleon's\
  \ Court) in 1884, by Ernest A. Vizetelly in 1897 (reprinted 2006), by Alec Brown\
  \ in 1958, and by Brian Nelson in 2018.\nThe novel is set in the highest echelons\
  \ of Second Empire government. It follows the career of Eugène Rougon and a dozen\
  \ or so of his cronies as they jockey for political favor and personal gain, and\
  \ embraces the public and personal life of Emperor Napoleon III.\nThe main character\
  \ is Eugène Rougon (b. 1811), the eldest son of Pierre and Félicité Rougon. Eugène\
  \ is first introduced in La fortune des Rougon as a key player in the coup d'état\
  \ of 1851 which established Napoleon III as Emperor of the French. Eugène's maneuverings\
  \ establish his parents' control over the town of Plassans and lay the foundations\
  \ for solidifying the family fortune. Eugène, acknowledged as one of the prime movers\
  \ in legitimizing the Emperor, has remained in Paris to further his quest for power.\n\
  Eugène's brothers are Pascal, who is the main character of Le docteur Pascal, and\
  \ Aristide, whose story is told in La curée and L'argent. He also has two sisters:\
  \ Sidonie, who appears in La curée, and Marthe, one of the protagonists of La conquête\
  \ de Plassans.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
